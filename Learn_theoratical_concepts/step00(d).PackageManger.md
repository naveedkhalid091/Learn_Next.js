## Installation and Initialization of a Package Managers (pnpm):

You can install one of your desired package manager for your projects:

**Install pnpm:** npm i -g pnpm
**Check Version:** pnpm -v
**Next.js Project Initialization:** pnpm create create-next-app@latest

You can also install `yarn` or `npm`.

If you are not sure which one to install then I have given comparison of these packages so that you may able to decide which one is suitable for you.

### Comparison of npm, Yarn, and pnpm

**npm:**

    - Default for Node.js; widely used.
    - Compatible with many libraries and tools.
    - Maintains support for older projects without migration.

**pnpm:**

    - Ideal for large projects with many dependencies.
    - Best choice for minimizing disk space usage.
