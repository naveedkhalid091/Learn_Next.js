## Catch-All Segments ([...folderName]):

`Role:` The [...folderName] syntax, known as "Catch-All Segments," allows you to handle multiple dynamic segments, including nested routes. This means you can generate routes at any depth, whether parallel or nested, while the dynamic segment's syntax [folderName] only allows you to create routes based on a single parameter. [folderName] allows you to generate pages at a specific level but doesn’t handle deeper or nested routes.

It is like a rest parameter in typeScript which allows you to create unlimited rest parameters. 

`Usage:` It’s useful for scenarios where you need to create routes with an arbitrary number of segments, including nested ones.


`Example`
pages/posts/[...slug].js
/posts/2024/08/06/first-post, /posts/2024/08/07second-post, etc.

## Note:
If you want to use variables in HTML or in React then you can apply variables inside the curly braceds{ }.
