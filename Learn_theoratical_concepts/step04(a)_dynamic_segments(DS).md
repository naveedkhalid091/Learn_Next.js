# Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes are essential for handling scenarios where web applications need to manage content for an unpredictable number of users or items. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their significance and implementation:

## Key Issues Addressed by Dynamic Routes:

### Issue 1: Creating Pages for Unknown Users

In applications like Facebook, developers may need to create pages based on user IDs. Since it's impossible to predict who will sign up in the future, dynamic routes allow for the creation of pages that can adapt to any user.

### Issue 2: Managing a Large Number of Pages

With millions or even billions of potential users, it's impractical to create separate static pages for each user. Dynamic routes help manage this vast number of pages efficiently by generating them as needed instead of pre-creating each one.

## Core Purpose

The primary reason for introducing dynamic routes is to handle large-scale content. Static pages become inefficient in scenarios where user counts are high, necessitating a more dynamic approach.

## Creating a Dynamic Segment

A dynamic segment can be created by wrapping a folder name in square brackets: `[folderName]`. These dynamic segments can be passed as parameters to functions like `layout`, `page`, `route`, and `generateMetadata`.

## Use Cases for Dynamic Routes

1. **Dynamic Content at Request Time**:

   - **Scenario**: The content changes frequently, and users can be either known or unknown.
   - **Approach**: Use dynamic routes with `getServerSideProps`. This allows the page to fetch and render updated information with each request, ensuring users always see the latest content.

2. **Static Content Pre-rendered at Build Time**:
   - **Scenario**: The content is relatively static and does not change frequently, regardless of whether users are known or unknown.
   - **Approach**: Utilize dynamic routes with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`. This pre-renders pages at build time, generating static HTML for each page based on known data, making the site faster and more efficient.

## Conclusion

Dynamic routes provide a powerful solution for web developers facing the challenges of scalability and unpredictability in user-generated content. By understanding and implementing dynamic routes, developers can create more flexible and responsive web applications.
