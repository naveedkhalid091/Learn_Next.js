## API data validation:

Inside the `step09_Route_handlers`, we will learn the form validation concept thourgh zod and `react-hook-form`,

Inside the zod when you will write schemas inside the
`lib` folders seperately then you can also import that schemas into the api form data i.e. `signin` or `signup`.

By following this method you will validate your data not only from the front-end but also from the back-end.
