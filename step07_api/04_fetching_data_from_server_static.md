## Fetching data from server (static):

For Coding Examples you can check the code `books-api-app` project where I have fetched data from the server/database. When you will click on the static page/Link then you will see data of Books which is fetched from the database.

However When you will fetch data from the sever by default the data will be rendered at once during the built time, when you will run command `pnpm run built` everytime when user will visit the page then he/she will see the data which was rendered at a built time once a time.

Check the code How the data was rendered. inside the `static` page of `books-api-app` project.
