## 1. Postman API:

Click on the [Postman](https://web.postman.co/) to visit the Postman website.

It is a platform or set of tools designed to help developers in building, managaing and testing APIs.

Postman is primarily focused on helping developers test APIs, it also allows for creating and managing APIs within a team, but it is not a marketplace for APIs.

Postman doesn't provide ready-made APIs for use but focuses on `tools to help developers` design, test, automate, and document their own or third-party APIs.

You can download the desktop version of postman or access postman through the website. The most preferable way to access it through the website beecasue it is a cloud softwere and you can access it anywhere.

## 2. Rapid API:

RapidAPI, on the other hand, is indeed a `marketplace` where developers can `discover and connect` to pre-built APIs. It focuses on providing `access to` a large collection of third-party APIs, making it easier for developers to integrate these APIs into their applications.
