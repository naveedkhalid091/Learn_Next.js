## API data validation:

As we have now learnt the validation concept thourgh `zod` and `react-hook-form`.

So, when we will write schema inside the `lib` folders seperately through the help of `Zod` then we can also import that schema into the `api` form data i.e. `signin` or `signup`.

By following this method we will validate our data not only from the front-end but also from the back-end and this will ensure the type safty as well.
