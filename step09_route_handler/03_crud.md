## Crud:

These are four basic operations that can be performed on resources (data) in a system.

Crud stands for:

1. **Create:** This operation adds new resources/data to the system. It corresponds to an HTTP `POST` request in RESTful APIs.
   **Example:** Adding a new user or creating a new product.
2. **Retrieve/Read:** This operation fetches resources/data from the system. It is generally associated with an `HTTP GET` request in RESTful APIs.

   - Example: Retrieving a list of users or getting the details of a specific product.

3. **Update:** This operation modifies existing resources/data. It is generally associated with an HTTP `PUT` or `PATCH` request in RESTful APIs.

   - Example: Updating the details of an existing user or product.

4. **Delete:** This operation removes resources/data from the system. It corresponds to an `HTTP DELETE` request in RESTful APIs.

   - Example: Removing a user from the database or deleting a product from inventory.

See the `coding_practice` folder for all of these examples, these methods are written as an example only, by following these examples you can get,push,delete,and update data from the databasis.
