## Dynamic API Route

Creating a dynamic API is the same concept which we had learnt to create the `dynamic routes`.

create a folder like book inside the `api` and inside the book create a dynamic folder called `[id]` and then inside the ID, create a `route.ts` file.

So, the API which you will create inside the [id] folder will be called a dynamic API.
