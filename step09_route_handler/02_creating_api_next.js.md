## How to create an API in Next.js

1. Make a folder named `api` inside the app folder.
2. Now I will create a path of an `api` by creating a sub folder into the `api` folder.
   let suppose you have given `hello` name of your api, so you will create a sub folder with name `hello` inside the `api`.
3. Now create a file under the sub folder with name `route.ts`.
4. f you wanted more then one apis to create then create another folders inside the `api`.
5. Write a code (function) inside the `route.ts` file.
   Note: APIs only call your functions which you have created inside the route.ts.
