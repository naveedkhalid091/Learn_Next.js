## Align Content

This utility is very rarely used in real world.

The utilities of `Align content` are given below:

`content-start:`
`content-end:`
`content-center:`
`content-between:`
`content-around:`
`content-evenly:`

Use Cases:
Use it when managing the alignment of multiple rows or columns within a flex or grid container.

If your flex container has only one row element (i.e. itâ€™s a single line content), then the `align-content` utility will not have any visible effect. In such cases, you would use `align-items` to manage the alignment of items within that single row.
