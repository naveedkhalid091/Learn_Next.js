## Flex Direction

As we have studied `justify-content` which allows to move the items along the main axis (Horizontal) without changing the axis direction and we have also studied the `align-item` which allows to move the items along with the cross axis(Vertical direction) it also doesn't change the exis postion.

But `flex direction` does `change the direction of an axis` if you have mentioned justify content it will move the items horizontally and similary if you will mention now the flex direction property it will change the horizontal axis into verical axis.

- `flex-row`: Arranges flex container's items in a horizontal row (left to right).
- `flex-row-reverse`: Arranges flex container's items in a horizontal row, but in reverse order (right to left).
- `flex-col`: Arranges flex items in a vertical column (top to bottom).
- `flex-col-reverse`: Arranges flex items in a vertical column, but in reverse order (bottom to top).
