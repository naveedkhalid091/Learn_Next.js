## Flex Direction

As we have studied `justify-content` which allows to move the items along the main exis (Horizontall) without changing the exis direction and we have also studied the `align-item` which allows to move the items alon with the cross exis(Vertical direction) it also does't change the exis postion.

But `flex direction` does `change the direction of an exis` if you have mentioned justify content it will move the items horizontally and similary if you will mention now the flex direction property it will change the horizontall exis into verical exist and will allow you to move in vertical postion as well.

- `flex-row`: Arranges flex items in a horizontal row (left to right).
- `flex-row-reverse`: Arranges flex items in a horizontal row, but in reverse order (right to left).
- `flex-col`: Arranges flex items in a vertical column (top to bottom).
- `flex-col-reverse`: Arranges flex items in a vertical column, but in reverse order (bottom to top).
