## 1. `What is FlexBox`?

Flex is a one dimensional layout setting system.

It is best to use flex for simpler layouts where alignment is in one direction, it aligns items along a single axis (row or column).

When we define an element as a `flex` its childs (flex items) are automatically arranged according to the rules defined in `flex` as a parent.

## Creating a flex container.

To make an element a `flex container`, you write the `flex` property into a parent element i.e. `className="flex" `. This mentioning will make all the nested childs the `flex elements/items`. These `flex items` will then follow the `flex layout rules` defined by the parent.

`Note`: flex property would not work in child elements if you will not metion `flex` keyword inside the parent elements.

## Flexbox-utility types:

i) `Justify Content`
ii) `align-items`
iii) `Flex Wrap`
iv) `Flex Direction`
v) `Flex Grow and Shrink`:

We will discuss all of these in detail in coming steps
