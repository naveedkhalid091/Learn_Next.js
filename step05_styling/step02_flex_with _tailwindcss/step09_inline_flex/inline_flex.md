## Inline flex:

use this utility if you wanted to show all items or icons in a single row.

`For Example:`
If you have 3 images links of social media pages and you want them to show inline then you use this property.

It is recommended to use `inline-flex` property into the parent element so that all childs behave should simoutaneously.
