## Understanding the Screen Size of elements/tag

There are two types of elements in HTML:

1.  Block level elements:
2.  inline elements:

## Block level elements:

Take up full width and stack vertically

#### `Default width`:

Without styling the default width is 100% of the parents' element width.

#### `Default Height`:

The default height is zero without styling`if no content is written but if the content is written then height is only equals to the hight of content.

#### `Arrangment of elements`:

The emelents `stack/arranged vertically`on one and another.`Styling`: The adjustment of height and width of elements can be done in styling.
You will learn about elements' padding, margin, column and rows further in upcoming topics.

## 2. Inline elements:

Take up only as much width as needed and flow horizontally:
