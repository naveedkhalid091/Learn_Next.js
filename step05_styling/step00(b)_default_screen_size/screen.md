## Understanding the Screen Size of elements/tag

There are two types of elements in HTML:

1.  Block level elements:
2.  Inline elements:

## Block level elements:

- Take up full width depending on your screen size.
-

#### `Default width`:

Without styling and by default, the block-level elements take up the **full width** depending on the screen size and stack vertically (one on top of another).

#### `Default Height`:

- If there is no content, the height will be zero.
- If content is present, the height adjusts to fit the content.

#### `Arrangement of elements`:

**Styling**: The adjustment of height and width of elements can be done in styling.
You will learn about elements' padding, margin, column and rows further in upcoming topics.

## 2. Inline elements:

Take up only as much width as needed and flow horizontally:

Below elements are inline elements:

`Image tag and other self closing tags`

`Input tag`

`Button tag`

#### Examples :

All elements are block level elements other then inline elements.
