Order utility:

Us the `order` utlitity if you need to change the order of elements.

For Example:

<div> 
<img src='' className='order-last'/>
<img src='' className=''/>
<img src='' className=''/>
</div>

Order property is also used in flex item and the value can be any number positive or negative. The item with the greater order value will appear later while the lesser value order will aprear first.

The default value of order is `0`.

order-1 (Any number from 1 to 12 are available)
order-last
order-first
order-none (Default)

`Note:`
The order settings is usually required in responsiveness or you need to adjust the order of elements depending on screen sizes.

`For Example:` Logos and links are showing on the same line in `big screen` but we need to show logos first and then links on second line in the `small screens`.
