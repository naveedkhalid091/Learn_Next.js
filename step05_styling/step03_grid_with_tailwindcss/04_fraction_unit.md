## fraction Unit(fr):

The `fr` is short for fraction representing fraction of the remaining space:

lets understand the remaining space from below example:

`className="grid-col-[22rem,1fr]`

## Note:

we have already learnt about `rem` at step `000(a)_css_units` inside the `step005_styling`

Above code will have two coloums one with 22rem (352px) of width and other has 1fr (Means remaining space has been alloted to another column)

similarly look another example for more understanding:

`className="grid-col-[22rem,2fr]`

Above code will have three coloums one with 22rem (352px) of width and other has 2fr (Means remaining space has been alloted to other two columns equally.. and so on)
