## Understanding auto-fit Concept:

`auto-fit` is related to CSS Grid and is used to automatically adjust the number of grid columns based on the available space.

#### How `auto-fit` Works:

When you use auto-fit, the grid tries to fit as many columns as possible within the available container width. If there's more space, it adds more columns; if there's less space, it removes columns.

#### Use Case for `auto-fit`:

auto-fit is particularly useful for responsive layouts where you want the grid items to fill the available space nicely without leaving gaps, making it ideal for fluid designs like image galleries or card layouts.
