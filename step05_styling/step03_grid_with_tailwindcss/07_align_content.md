## Align Content

This utility is very rarely used in real world.

The utilities of `Align content` are given below:

`content-start:`

`content-end:`

`content-center:`

`content-between:`

`content-around:`

`content-evenly:`

Use Cases:
Use it when managing the alignment of multiple rows or columns within a flex or grid container.

If your grid container has only one row of items (i.e., itâ€™s a single line of content), the `align-content` utility will not have any visible effect. In such cases, you would use `align-items` to manage the alignment of items within that single row.
