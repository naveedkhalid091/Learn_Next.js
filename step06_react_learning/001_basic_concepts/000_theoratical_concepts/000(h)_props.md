## What are Props (short for properties)?

The analogy of concepts between the `props` and `attributes` is similar.

In HTML, `attributes are predefined` and can't be customized. However, in React, we can create our own attributes or properties `(called props)` and after creation of props we can use them in other components.

#### Comparison between attributes and props:

- First - In attributes you can only pass string or boolean data types but in props you can pass any data types including arrays, objects and functions.

- Second - Attributes are pre defined but props are fully customizable.

* Third - you can only pass static data into attributes but in props you can also pass the dynamic data.

Hence the definition of Props will be as follows:

#### Props definition:

In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent component to a child component.
The child component receiving the props cannot modify them directly.

React also has certain reserved (predefined) props like `key`, `ref`, and `children`. Developers can only use these reserved props according to specific rules defined by React."
