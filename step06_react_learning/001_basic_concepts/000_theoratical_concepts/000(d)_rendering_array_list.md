## Rendering list

**Displaying an array of data dynamically`**, is called rendering a list in react.

## How Data is rendered?:

Letâ€™s say you have an array of products:

```typescript
export const products = [
  { title: "Cabbage", id: 1 },
  { title: "Garlic", id: 2 },
  { title: "Apple", id: 3 },
];
```

You can display above data into any page through `map function` after importing the `array` page into the required page.

The map function is a method of an array, which works same as loops.

The **map function i.e `map()`** iterate over the array, during each iteration it generates a piece of JSX/TSX` for each item of the array.

#### `key prop`:

When rendering a list, React requires you to include `a unique key prop` for `each element`. This `helps` React optimize rendering by `identifying which items have changed`, been added, or removed.

#### For Example:

```typescript
/*File:products.tsx*/

export const products = [
  { title: "Cabbage", id: 1 },
  { title: "Garlic", id: 2 },
  { title: "Apple", id: 3 },
];
```

```typescript
/*File: index.tsx*/
const listItems = products.map((product) => (
  <li key={product.id}> {product.title} </li>
));

return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Note that how `<li>` has a key attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happen if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.

#### Why the key Prop is Important:

React uses the key prop to track elements between updates. This allows React to determine if an element should be re-rendered, which improves performance and prevents unnecessary updates.

## Exmaple 2 with styling impact:

```typescript
const products = [
{ title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 },
{ title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 },
{ title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 },
];

export default function ShoppingList() {

    const listItems = products.map(product =>
            <li key={product.id} style={{
            color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen'
        }} >
            {product.title}

        </li>

);

return (

    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    );

}
