## Conditional Rendering:

Conditional rendering in React is how you decide what to show in the UI based on certain conditions. It's like saying, "If this condition is true, show this thing; otherwise, show something else."

In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, youâ€™ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:

        let content;

        if (isLoggedIn) {
        content = <AdminPanel />;
        } else {
        content = <LoginForm />;
        }
        return (
        <div>
            {content}
        </div>
        );

#### Using the Ternary Operator:

Another way to do this is with the ternary operator. It's a shorter way to write the same logic.

    function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
    return (
        <h1>{isLoggedIn ? 'Welcome back!' : 'Please log in.'}</h1>
    );
    }

Here, isLoggedIn ? 'Welcome back!' : 'Please log in.' means if isLoggedIn is true, show "Welcome back!", otherwise show "Please log in."
