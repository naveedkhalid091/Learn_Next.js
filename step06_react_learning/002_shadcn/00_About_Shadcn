## What is Shadcn?

It open source library built with tailwind and React.

This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

The library offers a range of built-in components, such as buttons, forms, modals, and more, to help developers build aesthetically pleasing and functional user interfaces efficiently.

#### How to use the components of Shadcn in your project?

1. Run the init command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

command for pnpm:
`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`
command for npm:
`npx shadcn@latest init`
command for yarn:
`npx shadcn@latest init`

After above command, Shadcn will begin installation into your project and will ask prompt questions as it ask in installing the Next.js project.

Common questions will be:

1. `Which style would you like to use?` You should select `NewYork`.
2. `Which color would you like to use as the base color` You can shoose any but first time I have selected `slate`.
3. Would you like to use CSS variables for theming? Select `yes`.

After that you would be able to use the Shadcn UI.

## For Example:

I am now copying the code from Shadcn Ui and pasting it inside the project.

To add Shadcn UI button in your app.

Write below command inside your project directory:
`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button`

The above command will make a folder called `components` inside the source directory and inside the components `ui` folder will be made automatically.
All the Shadcn components will be available inside the `ui` folder whenever you will use them.

As we have now mentioned the below command:

`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button`

so the `button.tsx` file is available inside the `ui` folder. you can check it.

To use this button now we can import it in our project.

as `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

See coding Exmaple inside the `01_shadcn` project.

## Changing the Shadcn Components.

We can also update (remove or Add styles) the predifined styles/variants of Shadcn UI components.

Below are two examples, the first one will tell you, how you can change the styles of a component within the styles set by the shadcn UI.

While the second example will explain how you can add your own styles inside the Shadcn components.

##### Example:

Until now we have used `Shadcn` Button in our example so lets carry-on on this Button example.

First go inside the `components/ui/button.tsx`, you will see different style and size variant are pre-defined by the Shadcn UI.

To use that variants, write the variant props inside your button like below:

     <Button variant=""> Shadcn UI Button</Button>

IntelliSense will automatically give you suggestions about the style versions available in a button.

##### Example-2:

Inside the `variants` of `Button.tsx`, you can define your own properties/styles of a button and use it.

Suppose :

`myself:" px-1 my-4 bg-blue-500 rounded hover:text-lg hover:bg-blue-300"`,

Write above mentioned `myself` property inside the pre-build variants of Shadcn UI button inside the `button.tsx` file and use it in a page where you have added button as

    <Button variant="myself"> Shadcn UI Button</Button>

This was all about isntalation and usage of components.
